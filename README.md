Through this application developers can create a profile and upload their projects on the platform to showcase their skills to hiring managers.

Through this application hiring managers can search for developers based on location, expertise, stack, years of experience and so on.

One major challenge I faced while build this application was the implementation of a views count system that can be displayed based on the views/click each developers project, to solve this problem I made used of Djangoâ€™s hitcount library in this article [link] I explained how to use this library on your project.
